# credit-card
For duping people off credit card info (just for educational purposes)

Page with html and javascript which convinces people to put their credit card info in, makes them think that it is going to scan some databases to find if their cc info is stolen (Actually it is not), then sends an XHR request to a php page with cc info, which then stores it into a text file.
